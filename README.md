# OneMiner
Simple UI to mixed GPU Miners(Nvidia &amp; AMD) for Ethereum, ZCash  etc.

The name was meant to signify that it is a one click miner but also to hold a subtle  reference to the 'One Ring" from 'Lord of the Rings'. But I hold no delusions of grandeur about its supremacy.


You should use this for the following reasons
1. You mine any coins under Ethhash, Equihash
2. You have both Nvidia and AMD cards and struggle to setup the console miner


Features
1. Automatic connection to Wifi
2. Automatically mine the most profitable coin
3. Switch between coins with ease
4. Automatic Dual mining off on temperature increase
5. Benchmark against different algos aith profitability
6. Identify new coins in market for mining
7. supports 1 click mining(ethereum), silent mode/console mode(mines sither setup  thing or default ethereum) also
	by default u will have an ethereum miner. when you start it will ask for wallet address. future version will have automatic wallet generation with private key also
