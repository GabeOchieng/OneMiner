# OneMiner
As the name suggests, this is a 1 click miner for all GPU coins viz Ethereum, Zcash, Ubiq etc. It is especially built to handle situations when you have both AMD and Nvidia cards and have to use different softwares to mine on both cards.

The name might hold a subtle  reference to the 'One Ring" from 'Lord of the Rings' but it holds no delusions of grandeur about its supremacy :).

# Reasons to Use
The main reason to use this tool is that  setting up a miner is difficult. Especially if you have different GPU cards or if you want to switch between mining different coins or to different wallet adddresses. It becomes a lot script heavy to handle such situations. This tool was built to have all such functionality in 1 place. It is open source hence anyone can download the code/tool and use it as is or make modifications to suit his needs.

For instance, my prime motive behind the creation of this tool  was that I have a miner with both Nvidia and AMD cards. I was using Claymore miner for AMD and EWBF for Nvidia while mining Zcash. But sometimes when the newtwork is down the EWBF miner would die and never come back up. I had to manually launch it later. Writing scripts for everything was getting tedious. So I thought of creating this tool which would benefit everyone.

I tried out things like Awesome Miner and Minergate but both being closed source I wasnt sure of its legitamacy. With this project I intend to create a one stop tool which can mine almost anything and in as little steps as possible.

I would like to hear your feedback and thoughts if any. Please use the github issue tracker  to notify me of any issues or enhanement requests or send a mail to arun.satyarth@gmail.com.
